#IoT Midsem Project
All codes used for iot midsem project by Joel Adu-Kwarteng and Papa Aferi.

ultrasonic_lcd is the first piece of code we used to display values read by the ultrasonic sensor on the lcd.

the next thing we did was to try and push to the database, so we created db.ino separately. We used this code in conjunction with midsem.php

we then used the example code, "HelloServer" and named it "HelloServer2.0" to display values being read from the ultrasonic sensor on a web server.

we integrated all these codes into midsem2.ino.

The next thing we did was to create a dashboard page to display live values from the ultrasonic sensor using AJAX. this page is called htmlpage.h, as we integrated it with our arduino code.
